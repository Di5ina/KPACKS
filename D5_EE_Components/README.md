# D5 Electrical Engineering KPACK
Electronic components (mostly procedural) for use with the Blender addon Kit OPS by Chipp Walters found here: https://chippwalters.gumroad.com/l/kitopspro

The goal is to create inserts that are both accurate enough to be used for product mockups / marketing in the industrial design space while retaining good enough looks to be used as detailing components in the artistic space.

## Install
create a folder and either unzip the repository to it, or use the git CLI to clone the repository. In kit ops preferences add the parent folder. This project will be updated frequently so using git pull regularly is recommended.

## Change log
### 2/28/2022
* Project
  * Renamed to D5_EE_Components - This is a more friendly name for use directly in the kitops kpack list.

* d2tp_DIP_v01
  * added "Realize Instances" node right before final output. As this is a heavy nodegroup the realize instances allows the modifier to "be applied" once everything is set up to the user's liking.

## Roadmap
* SMD Chip
* SIP Chip
* BGA Chip
* QFP Chip
* Lower poly/lighter geometry node versions
* Standoffs
* collection of PCB markings
* Collection of parallax PCB traces for decal machine, possibly ported for kitops
* PCB material
* Template PCBs by form factor
  * ATX
  * Small Arduino-like
  * PCIe Card
  * Parametric
* Procedural Heat Sinks
* Procedural Resistors/Capacitors/Transistors/etc...
* cable inserts for common connections
  * motherboard power
  * SATA
  * RJ45
  * etc...
